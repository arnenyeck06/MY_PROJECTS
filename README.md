This repository contains SQL commands in ORACLE database. 

Use of AGGREGATE FUNCTION to analyze various aspects of the books in the database.

I create a dataset from a bike store database using SQL. This will involve querying the database to extract specific information related to bike sales and related data. I built a dataset that can be used for analysis and visualization purposes. I extract insights into the performance of the bike store, identify trends and patterns in sales data, and inform future business decisions.

I also showcase how to create tables, insert values, and stored procedure.
